  Wall Street Bets and DeepF**king Value

<p1> Hello, 
Since my senior year of highschool in 2017, I have been a member of r/wallstreetbets, and traded covered calls. I am not active in it by any means, but I still look around. This situation has been hilarious. WSB is millions of people larger, and they are trying to take on hedge funds. As for the first question in the assignment, which asks if collective action based on engagement on the internet constitutes limits. I do not like how this is worded and I am sure whoever is grading this has lost focus by this point so thank you as this will be very very boring. I do not like how this question is posed as it pertains to something in real life. It isn't Kony 2012, it isn't the January 6th insurrection, this caught the attention of Wall St. It is essentially billionaires trying to make a quick buck by letting a company die. To argue for limits, one would surely be helping out the 1% and the public would not like that. Places like Twitter and Instagram are private companies and they can do what they like, so to limit conversation from an outside source like the government or Wall St, would be very tough.

<p2>Second, researchers should be tracking the information campaigns that both sides started in order to further their respective agendas. Many things were thrown around on either sides such as funds supposedly closing out their positions, or the more common “HOLD THE LINE” and movements like that. Platforms, under a thing that Former President Donald Trump for some reason hates,called
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230"> Section 230</a> of the Communications Decency Act, allows social media platforms to not be liable for what their users post. It reminds me of MEGA but that is far in the past. Social media companies are not compelled to remove mundane stuff like this as they worry about Qanon and white supremacy talk on their platforms. How would you explain this case to an 80-year-old senator who's never heard of Reddit or short squeezes before but now wants to write regulations? Have a lobbyist do it. What are the security implications for online movements that can bankrupt multi-billion dollar investors? I don’t know, tell their spouse that they will have to sell a boat. Too bad. Over shorting a stock is textbook natural selection. I thought Wharton made better students than that.

<p3>Lastly, I am not sure that there will be any legislation besides allowing for retail investors and putting caps and transparency on short positions. No big hedge fund guy will get punished, obviously. I mean it took <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal"> Enron defrauding a whole state to get hurt by the SEC.</a> I mean even Jordan Belfort was given a slap on the wrist before the “I’m not leaving” speech. This has been a whirlwind over the last two months and I am glad that it brought attention and some money to normal people who opened 50k positions on $GME half a year ago. Not much will be made of this, <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/2/1/robinhood-raises-34-billion-to-fuel-record-customer-growth"> Robinhood has raised 3 billion dollars to have coverage against their clearing company that handles the trades as collateral.</a> Also this is 527 words so you do not have to count. Cheers.
