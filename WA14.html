      <h2>How I would present to 3 different sets of people</h2>
      </center>
      <p>In order to present to data scientists I would certainly use Jupyter notebook. This is because it is so intuitive to use, and with the skillset these scientists would have, they could easily interpret how to open an .ipynb file, as well as digest more robust information. This will be the easiest to show data made with Python though, and I could see why reveal.js could be useful to show HTML stuff. To show. TV show I actually used Python and Jupyter notebooks to show battles in Game of Thrones. Using markdown and headers, it is extremely easy to get a point across. </p>
      
      <p>I would use reveal.js to show web-based information to an audience that might not know how to code or have any experience. Would be very easy to send out a link like you guys do to follow along. It is very educational and can show blocks of code. Very good for beginners. I would use it to teach HTML concepts. </p>
     <br>
     


      <p>Finally, as I am losing all motivation inbetween my final things to do, I would like to use Python to do more SQL stuff from last semester. I use any possible reason to use Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Can you see how my paragraphs are getting shorter and shorter? It's not because I don't like you Abe and Brian, it's because I am a couple days away from having a stress meltdown.</p>
